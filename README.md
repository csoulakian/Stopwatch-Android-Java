# Background

The goal of this project is to convert a simple java stopwatch to an Android application.
The original java code can be found [here](https://github.com/concurrency-cs-luc-edu/simplestopwatch-java).

# Learning Objectives

* Simple dependency injection
* Event-driven program execution
* Modeling state-dependent behavior with state machine diagrams
* Distinguishing between view states and model states
* Implementing state-dependent behavior using the State pattern
* Mapping the model-view-adapter architecture to Android
* Fa&ccedil;de pattern for hiding complexity in the model from the adapter
* Distinguishing among dumb, reactive, and autonomous model components
* Background timers
* Concurrency issues: updating the view in the GUI thread

# Running the Application

* Android: as usual through Eclipse

# TODO

* architectural diagram
* testing
